Thanks for using WeatherUp!</br>
Here I describe how application collects, uses and handles your information when you use my applicatin!

###What & Why
The application collects your information only to provide service for you and only for that sole reason.

####Services
WeatherUp only uses your location to display it back to you, the user. </br>
The user is only one in possession of such information and the information is not sent anywhere nor it is processed in any<br>
other way than to just inform you of your current location.
User can save this location but only to phones memory and is totally in control of that information.

If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you(which it will not).
